Description of files in repository:  
proposal.pdf - This is the proposal document for the project, done before the project report and code was completed.
report.pdf - This is the final report detailing the project process and results etc.
code.ipynb - This contains the working code for the project. All cells have been run.
code - PPG.ipynb - This is the same as code.ipynb except that it is run on target stock 'PPG'. This target stock was run to test the robustness of the model. 
history.csv - This is the detailed breakdown of the training and validation loss against the number of epochs.
LR_prediction.csv - This details the exact values for predictions and truth labels for the linear regression benchmark model.
LSTM_prediction.csv - This details the exact values for predictions and truth labels for the LSTM model.
hyperparameter tuning.xlsx - This is a record of the relevant metrics for the different iterations of the model using different hyperparameters that were set manually.
